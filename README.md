🕸️ WebScraping Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python web scraping projects — small, focused tools that extract and organize data from various tech and cybersecurity sources.

Each scraper has its own folder with:

A scraper.py script

Its own README.md

A requirements.txt (if needed)

Example output (usually .csv)
